# Furigana Merger

## Overview

furigana-merger.py is a Python script designed to merge Japanese text with its corresponding furigana (phonetic annotations) in the format `{kanji|furigana}`, for use in the Obsidian Furigana Markdown extension. The script reads two input files: one containing the full Japanese text and another containing a kana-only version. It then processes these files to produce two output files: one with the merged text and another with the updated furigana.
